This is a personal project of mine with the goal to eventually implement an AI opponent that you can play Koi-Koi against. Currently, I am working on finishing up the gui elements, cleaning up some of the code, and reformatting files. The next steps for this project would be to decide what form of AI I would like to use and implementing an interface between the game logic and AI.

Makes use of [boost v1.87.0](https://www.boost.org/users/history/) and [raylib v5.5](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) libraries for convienience methods and graphics respectively.

The face-side textures were converted from svgs to pngs by me. The original files where created by Louie Mantia,

The 'backCard' texture was created by me.
