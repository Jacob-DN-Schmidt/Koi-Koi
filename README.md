This is a personal project of mine to eventually implement an AI opponent that you can play Koi-Koi against. 
Makes use of boost and raylib libraries for convienience methods and graphics respectively.

The face-side textures were converted from svgs to pngs by me. The original files where created by Louie Mantia,

and was shared under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license (more information can be found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The 'backCard' texture was created by me.
