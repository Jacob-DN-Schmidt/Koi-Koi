This file contains the formatting for a Koi-Koi gamestate used by this program.
Each entry (in and including the brackets; [*]) on each line is replaced by its respective value in the game where the active player is the player whose turn it is and the inactive player is the other player.
Each line is followed by a forward slash ('/') with exception for the final line.
Cards are in the format [month]_[suit] where: 
	[month] is the numerical representation of the month the flower belongs to; Pine = January = 1, Plum Blossom = February = 2, Cherry Blossom = March = 3, Wisteria = April = 4, Iris = May = 5, Peony = June = 6, Bush Clover = July = 7, Susuki Grass = August = 8, Chrysanthemum = September = 9, Maple = October = 10, Willow = November = 11, Paulownia = December = 12
	[suit] is the numerical representation of the suit; Kasu = 0, Tanzaku = 1, Akatan = 2, Aotan = 3, Hikari = 4
Lists of cards are delimited by commas (',')
Comments are contained within curly braces ('{}') and shall not be included in the implementation.
