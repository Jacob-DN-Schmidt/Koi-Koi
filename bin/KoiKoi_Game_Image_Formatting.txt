This file contains the formatting for a Koi-Koi gamestate used by the AI.
It is designed to reflect the info availible to the player whose turn it is while playing the game. 
Each entry (in and including the brackets; [*]) on each line is replaced by its respective value in the game where the active player is the player whose turn it is and the inactive player is the other player.
Each line is followed by a forward slash ('/') with exception for the final line.
